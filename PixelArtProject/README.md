# Pixel Art Maker Project

So I ditched the *form* since I'm still not up to speed with it. 
  
I changed it to a div, changed the submit input to a button, and ran with that. 
  
Used jQuery as much as I could.

Added features: erase, change color, event listeners outside of makeGrid, background, font color.
