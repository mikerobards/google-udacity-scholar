Your response goes here!

I learned figure, and also about Doctypes. 
I am fairly experience in HTML, so these lessons were pretty easy.
Not much of this so far has been difficult. 
The first project was pretty simple, but the Article was a bit more challenging. Only if ther was more content manipulation!
